1. Create a cluster from ARM (with resource group I guess) :
    output -> cluster name
    endpoint URL
2. Have ARM tested locally
    - add tests for ARM in test pipeline
3. Create Service Connection Automatically, inputs: clusterName, subscription, name, namespace
4. Remove resource group
5. Add perfect pipeline integration example

Inputs: group name, cluster name
    Create pipeline, if cluster name is provided use that for ARM deployment
    Perhaps delete cluster with Azure CLI task- because currently ARM templates do not support decomissioning
